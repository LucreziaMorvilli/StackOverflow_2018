## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

The aim of this project is to analyse the results of the Stack Overflow 2018 survey and to answer a few questions on the participants' features.  


## File Description <a name="whats-included"></a>

Below the link where I downloaded 2018 survey data:
  
  <https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/>

The repository contains this README file as well as a jupyter notebook containing the Python code for the analysis.


## Project Findings <a name="findings"></a>

The following questions were answered with this project:

1) What's the distribution of formal education among the participants? --> 44% of them achieved a Bachelor's Degree and 22% a Master's Degree

2) Is there a relation between formal education and job/career satisfaction? --> generally a higher formal education corresponds to higher satisfaction

3) Do developers with different education have different hopes for the next 5 years? There is very little to no correlation between the two.

You can find a more detailed description of the results [here](https://medium.com/@lumo17/yesterdays-developers-their-satisfaction-levels-and-hopes-for-the-future-2db41498624a).
